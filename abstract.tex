Mutation testing is widely used in research (even if not in practice).
Mutation testing tools usually target only one programming language,
and rely on parsing a program to generate mutants, or operate not at
the source level but on compiled bytecode.  Unfortunately,
developing a robust mutation testing tool for a new language in this paradigm
is a difficult and time-consuming undertaking.  Moreover,
bytecode/intermediate language mutants are difficult for programmers
to read and understand.  This paper presents a simple tool, called {\tt universalmutator},
based on regexp-defined transformations of source code.  The
regexp-based approach
provides multiple advantages.  First, our tool is easy to adapt to new
languages; e.g., we present here the first mutation tool for the Apple's
Swift programming language.  Second, the method makes handling
multi-language programs and systems simple, because the same tool can
support every language.  Finally, our approach
makes it easy for users to add custom, project-specific mutations.
The drawback is that the approach can generate some mutants that do
not compile or miss to generate some mutants that would have compiled.

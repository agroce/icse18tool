Mutation testing tools usually target only one programming language,
and rely on parsing a program to generate mutants, or operate not at
the source level but on compiled bytecodes.  Unfortunately,
developing a mutation testing tool for a new language in this paradigm
is a difficult and time-consuming undertaking.  Moreover,
bytecode/intermediate language mutants are difficult for programmers
to read and understand.  This paper presents a tool, the {\tt universalmutator},
based on regexp-defined transformations of source code.  The
regexp-based approach
provides multiple advantages.  First, our tool is easy to adapt to new
languages; e.g. we present here the first mutation tool for Apple's
Swift programming language.  Second, the method makes handling
multi-language programs and systems simple, since the same tool can
support each language.  Finally, our approach
makes it easy for users to add custom, project-specific, mutations.

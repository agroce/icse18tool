Mutation testing tools usually target only one programming language,
and rely on parsing a program to generate mutants, or operate not at
the source level but on compiled bytecodes.  Unfortunately,
developing a mutation testing tool for a new language in this paradigm
is a difficult and time-consuming undertaking.  We introduce a tool
based on specifying regexp-defined transformations of source code that
makes it easy to mutate programs across a variety of languages.  This
provides multiple advantages.  First, our tool is easy to adapt to new
languages.  As a proof-of-concept, we offer the ability to create
mutants of swift programs.  Second, the method makes handling
multi-language programs and systems simple.  Finally, our approach
makes it easy for users to add custom, project-specific, mutations.

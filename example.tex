\section{Example Usage}

The tool can easily be installed using Python's {\tt pip} package management system:

\begin{code}
pip install universalmutator
\end{code}

The module is pure Python and depends on no modules other than
built-in Python libraries, so should be useable on almost any system
that supports Python 2.7+.  Mutation with TCE of a particular
language, of course, may depend on having that language's compiler
available (e.g., {\tt swiftc} is used to compile swift code).

To mutate a source file, simply type:


\begin{code}
mutate <sourcefile>
\end{code}

If the source file extension is one of those supported (currently {\tt
  .c}, {\tt .cpp}, {\tt .java}, {\tt .py}, and {\tt .swift}), the tool
will automatically determine the rules to use and generate a set of
mutants.  For example, if {\tt <sourcefile>} is {\tt avltree.c}, it
will generate {\tt avltree.mutant.0.c}, {\tt avltree.mutant.1.c}, and
so forth.  For Swift and Python files, the tool will also attempt to
compile each mutant, and only generate mutant files for mutants that
(1) compile without syntax errors and (2) do not produce equivalent
object files to either the original source code or another
already-generated mutant.  Because the use of include files and
compiler directives makes it difficult to automatically check C files
for successful compilation, the tool also supports a mode where the
user provides a compilation command to be used to check for valid
mutants, e.g.:


\begin{code}
mutate foo.c --cmd ''clang -c MUTANT -I .''
\end{code}

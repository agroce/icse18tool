\section{Example Usage}

The tool can easily be installed using Python's {\tt pip} package management system:

\begin{code}
pip install universalmutator
\end{code}

The module is pure Python and depends on no modules other than built-in Python libraries, so should be useable on almost any system that supports Python 2.7+.  Mutation with TCE of a particular language, of course, may depend on having that language's compiler available (e.g., {\tt swiftc} is used to compile swift code).

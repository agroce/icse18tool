\section{Conclusion}

While most mutation tools either attempt to parse a source file or
operate at the bytecode level, this paper proposes another
possibility:  we present {\tt universalmutator}, a multi-language tool based on simple regular-expression
defined transformations of source as un-parsed text.  The advantages
of the approach are its simplicity of extension, ability to work on files that do
not actually parse, and the ease with which it supports adding

mutation support for new programming languages.  As future work, we plan to extend the ease of use of the tool, further integrate it with popular build environments, and add new languages, such as Rust.
{\tt univeralmutator} is open-source and publically availble on GitHub, at \url{https://github.com/agroce/universalmutator}

\section{Evaluation}

As a simple evaluation of the capabilities of our approach, we compared the mutants generated by {\tt
  universalmutator} to those generated by Andrews' tool \cite{mutant},
used in papers on mutation-based model checking of C programs
\cite{ASE15} and mutations as a tool for improving Linux kernel test
suites \cite{mutation17}.  The mutants generated by our tool were a
superset of those generated by Andrews' tool for the 8 C files used in
these papers.  Most importantly, the actual mutants used to drive
fixes to the model-checking harnesses or the Linux kernel test suite
were produced by both tools.

We also applied our tool to an ongoing effort to test the {\tt
  pyfakefs} file system \cite{pyfakefs}, using TSTL \cite{nfm15,tstlsttt},
and confirmed that our mutants were equally useful for test suite
evaluation and improvement as the mutants produced by a much more
complex, AST-based tool, {\tt muupi} \cite{muupi}.

  \caption{\label{tab:java} Java mutation results}
  \begin{tabular}{|l|lll|lll|lll|}
    \hline
    Subjects&\multicolumn{3}{c|}{PIT}&\multicolumn{3}{c|}{Major}&\multicolumn{3}{c|}{{\tt universalmutator}}\\
    &Gen&Kill&MS&Gen&Kill&MS&Gen&Kill&MS\\\hline
\hline
    {\tt Triangle}&45&44&97.78\%&130&130&93.53\%&188&184&97.87\%\\
{\tt FizzBuzz}&111&92&82.88\%&244&202&82.79\%&203&176&86.70\%\\
  \hline\end{tabular}
  \end{table}

Finally, we compared our results to PIT (Version 1.2.5-SNAPSHOT)
\cite{pittest} and Major (Version v1.3.2) \cite{major} for both the
classic {\tt Triangle} example and a real-world GitHub project, {\tt
  FizzBuzz}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition}
}.  Note that we used all the default mutation operators for both
Major and PIT. Also, to illustrate, here are the commands that we used to
perform mutation testing using {\tt universalmutator} for {\tt
  Triangle}:
{\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
% mkdir mutants
% mutate src/main/java/triangle/Triangle.java --mutantDir mutants
...
% analyze_mutants src/main/java/triangle/Triangle.java "mvn test"
  --mutantDir mutants
\end{verbatim}
} The experimental results are shown in Table~\ref{tab:java}. For each
tool on each subject, we show the number of all generated mutants
(Column ``Gen''), the number of killed mutants (Column ``Kill''), and
the mutation score (Column ``MS''). From the table, we can observe that all the three tools provide consistent mutation scores, demonstrating the validity of our tool for Java.

\mycomment{For {\tt Triangle},
  PIT generates 87 mutants, of which 85 are killed for a 97.70\%
  mutation score.  Major generates 139 mutants, of which 130 are
  killed for a mutation score of 93.53\%.  The {\tt universalmutator}
  using the following commands, generates 188 mutants, of which 184
  are killed for a mutation score of 97.87\%:}
